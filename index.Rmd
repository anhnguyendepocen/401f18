## Final exam materials

<!--

* Topics for the final exam will include

1. F tests.

2. Prediction intervals.

3. Confidence intervals for linear model coefficients.

4. Normal approximations and mean/variance calculations.

5. Linear model diagnostics.

6. Colinearity and its consequences.

7. Building and interpreting design matrices for models with interactions and factors.

8. Observational studies and causation.

* The style and format of the final exam will be based on the practice final exam below. The exam will work through a data analysis, asking questions to requiring understanding of the statistical techniques used, how they are computed, and how they are interpreted.

* [Practice final exam](final/practice/practice.pdf), with [solutions](final/practice/sol_practice.pdf) for questions not discussed in class.

* [Exam](final/final401w18/final401w18.pdf). [Solutions](final/final401w18/sol_final401w18.pdf).
