**Your report should include the R code that you use. For calculations, please add enough explanation to help the reader understand what you did and why. Recall that you are permitted to collaborate, or to use any internet resources, but you must list all sources that influenced your report. As usual, a statement of _Sources_ is required to get credit for the homework.**


**Optional: If you like, you are encouraged to write your homework report as an Rmarkdown document**. The [slides for Lab 11](https://ionides.github.io/401f18/Lab/Lab11/R_markdown_Introduction.html) are a good start. Rmarkdown is a powerful tool for applied statistics, since it leads to reproducible analysis that can be relatively easily modified and shared. Combining text, code and R output helps to clarify what you did, why you did it, what you found, and what you conclude. 
You can edit the [Rmarkdown file generating this homework](https://ionides.github.io/401f18/hw/hw11/hw11.Rmd) as a starting point. You are not expected to use the math typesetting in \LaTeX for Rmarkdown (though you can try it if you want to). You can add blank lines to handwrite equations, by using `<br>` in Rmarkdown which gives a line of blank space if you render the Rmarkdown as HTML. `<br><br><br>` gives three blank lines in HTML, which looks like:

<br>
<br>
<br>

Or you can just represent equations in text, writing for example Y[i]=X beta[i] + epsilon[i] in place of $\vec{Y}=\mat{X}\vec{\beta}+\vec{\epsilon}$.

### Data analysis: investigating hospital infections

This homework asks you to develop your own data analysis, starting with just the dataset and some background information.
Data on 12 variables for 113 hospitals from the Study on the Efficacy of Nosocomial Infection Control (SENIC) are provided in the file [senic.txt](senic.txt). 
The primary purpose of this study is to look for properties of hospitals associated with high (or low) rates of hospital-acquired infections, which have the technical name of *nosocomial infections*.
The rate of nosocomial infections is measured by the variable `Infection risk`.
The SENIC study was described in a sequence of articles in The American Journal of Epidemiology, Volume 111, Issue 5, 1980, Pages 465â€“653. 
You are not expected to read these articles.
Nosocomial infection continues to be a concern for hospital management, and SENIC was a landmark study on this topic. 
The variables are described as follows:

**Hospital**: index from 1 to 113

**Length of stay**: average duration (in days) for all patients

**Age**: average age (in years) for all patients

**Infection risk**: estimated percentage of patients acquiring an infection in hospital

**Culture**: average number of cultures for each patient without signs or symptoms of hospital-acquired infection, times 100

**X-ray**: number of X-ray procedures divided by number of patients without signs or symptoms of pneumonia, times 100

**Beds**: average number of beds in the hospital

**Med school**: does the hospital have an affiliated medical school (1=Yes;2=No)

**Region**: geographic region (1=North-East, 2=North-Central, 3=South, 4=West)

**Patients**: average daily census of number of patients in the hospital

**Nurses**: average number of full-time equivalent registed and licensed nurses

**Facilities**: percent of 35 specific facilities and services which are provided by the hospital

Explore these data to find statistically supported evidence of associations that might explain nosocomial infection risk.
You are expected to use the linear modeling techniques we have learned in class, including the F test, confidence intervals and diagnostic checks of model assumptions.
You should present at least one appropriate graph.
You may try as many different models as you like, but focus your report on a subset of analyses that you find informative.
Numerical analysis that you present should be combined with explanation of your methods and conclusions.
Your report should be clear about your original contribution above and beyond what you have acquired from other sources (classmates, web pages, or any other source). 
Material from sources should be clearly referenced to the list of sources. 
Be generous and explicit about the credit you give to sources so that the reader does not have to carry out detective work to assess your own contribution.
