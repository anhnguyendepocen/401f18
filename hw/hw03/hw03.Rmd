### More swirl lessons

Continuing from Homeworks 1 and 2, complete the following swirl modules: ```Lesson 12: Looking at Data```, ```Lesson 13: Simulation``` and ```Lesson 15: Base Graphics```. 
For now, we will not need the material in Lessons 10, 11 and 14, but you can do any or all of these too if you like. 

**Q1**. Write a brief comment on what you did with swirl, which tutorials you successfully completed, and the techical or conceptual obstacles (if any) that you encountered and (hopefully) overcame. This could be as little as a single sentence.

**Q2**.
