\frametitle{STATS 401 and the future of undergraduate data science
}

\begin{myitemize}

\item Data Science is \myemph{the use of modern technology for collecting and analyzing data.}

\item This sounds a whole lot like \myemph{modern applied statistics} but data science is currently a more sexy name.

\item Either way, a modern course in applied statistics should be hard to distinguish from a course in data science.

\item How to teach data science is a major open question, under discussion at the top levels of academia.

\item It follows that how to teach applied statistics is worthy of the same attention.

\item The new STATS 401 gives the topic the attention it deserves!

Rename STATS 401: Foundations of [Statistical] Data Science

\frametitle{A report by the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine}


\begin{myitemize}
\item For the current consensus on data science education, we draw on a 2018 National Academies repot on {\em  Data Science for Undergraduates: Opportunities and Options}.
  
\item ``As data science programs develop, they [data science courses and programs] should focus on attracting students with varied backgrounds and degrees of preparation.''

\item ``A key goal is to give all students the ability to make good judgments, use tools responsibly and effectively, and ultimately make good decisions using data. The committee defines this collection of abilities as `data acumen.' To that end, students will need exposure to material from multiple disciplines---notably, mathematical, statistical, and computational foundations---and they will need training in data acquisition, modeling, management and curation, data visualization, workflow and reproducibility, communication and teamwork, domain-specific considerations, and ethical problem solving.''

\item We will consider how STATS 401 develops these topics, in the context of a second class in Statistics.

NAS p21:
"Building on the work of De Veaux et al. (2017), the committee puts forth the following key concept areas for data science: mathematical foun- dations, computational foundations, statistical foundations, data man- agement and curation, data description and visualization, data model- ing and assessment, work ow and reproducibility, communication and teamwork, domain-specific considerations, and ethical problem solving."

NAS p22
"Mathematics is essential for data science; however, how much and what types of mathematics are needed vary. Data scientists need to know how to test hypotheses and determine why they do or do not align to real-world problems. They need to be capable of assessing their data science models, determining when these models fail and how to make corrections that lead to scientific discovery. Tools (e.g., Wolfram Alpha) can be utilized and combined to produce an outcome (e.g., simulation or visualization) that reinforces data scientists’ computational and statistical knowledge without demanding the study of calculus in full detail."

NAS p23
Key mathematical concepts/skills critical for the success of those involved in data science include:
• Working with sets and basic logic,
• Multivariate thinking via functions and graphical displays,
• Basic probability theory and randomness,
• Matrices and basic linear algebra,

NAS p25
Important statistical foundations for carrying out data science might include the following:
• Variability, uncertainty, sampling error, and inference;
• Multivariate thinking;
• Nonsampling error, design, experiments (e.g., A/B testing), biases, confounding, and causal inference;
• Exploratory data analysis;
• Statistical modeling and model assessment;
• Simulations and experiments.

NAS Conclusions (p88)

Recommendation 2.2: Academic institutions should provide and evolve a range of educational pathways to prepare students for an array of data science roles in the workplace.
Finding 2.3: A critical task in the education of future data scientists is to instill data acumen. This requires exposure to key concepts in data science, real-world data and problems that can reinforce the limita- tions of tools, and ethical considerations that permeate many applica- tions. Key concepts involved in developing data acumen include the following:
• Mathematical foundations,
• Computational foundations,
• Statistical foundations,
• Data management and curation,
• Data description and visualization,
• Data modeling and assessment,
• Work flow and reproducibility,

From the National Academies report ``Undergraduate Data Science: Opportunities and Options.''

``More work is needed to create courses that can provide sufficient mathematical and statistical backgroundwithout a long succession of prerequisite courses, while also ensuring that students have strength in algorithmic thinking, data technologies, and domain knowledge''

\frametitle{How is this different from tradional applied statistics?}

\begin{myitemize}
\item Applied statistics has been moving steadily toward the modern data science era.

\item Traditionally, much emphasis was placed on learning specific statistical tests, how to carry them out, how to interpret them, how to use them wisely.

\item Datasets of growing size and complexity put increasing emphasis on creativity. We end up making a statistical conclusion, but much of the work involves manipulating data and formalizing our questions to bring the two together.

\item Modern computation frees us from the burden of carrying out computations. We must still understand what is going on inside the computer so we can guide the computer toward a sensible and correct analysis.
