**Solution**:

The center is at about `r mean5.6`. The points of inflection on the density are at about `r mean5.6-sd5.6` and `r mean5.6+sd5.6`, which should be the mean plus/minus one standard deviation. It looks like about 95% of the area is between `r mean5.6-2*sd5.6` and `r mean5.6+2*sd5.6`, which should be the mean plus/minus two standard deviations. These facts are consistent with a mean of `r mean5.6` and an SD of `r sd5.6`.
