Let $Y$ be a random variable that takes values $0$, $1$, $2$ or $3$. Probability $Y=0$ is 0.4, $Y=1$ is 0.3 and $Y=2$ is 0.2.  

(a) What is the probability of $Y=3$?

```{r,child="sol_q5a-4.Rmd",eval=SOL}
```

(b) Assume $Y$ denotes the number of heads upon tossing a weighted coin tree times. If you and your friend want to place a bet at the number of heads in three tosses of the coin, what would your bet be?

```{r,child="sol_q5b-5.Rmd",eval=SOL}
```

(c) Find the variance of $Y$.
```{r,child="sol_q5c-5.Rmd",eval=SOL}
```
