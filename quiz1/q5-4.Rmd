The average midterm score of 20 students is 40 out of a maximum of 75. The professor realizes that she missed one student and upon including his score, the average went up by one point and became 41.

(a) What is the midterm score of the 21st student?

```{r,child="sol_q5a-4.Rmd",eval=SOL}
```

(b) Suppose the sample mean and variance are 41 and 36, and we model the midterm scores as being a draw from a normal distributed with these parameters. What is the chance that a student drawn at random gets over 59? Write your answer as a call to `pnorm()` and also give an approximate answer based on your knowledge of the normal distribution.


```{r,child="sol_q5b-4.Rmd",eval=SOL}
```
