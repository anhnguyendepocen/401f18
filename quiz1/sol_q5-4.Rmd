**Solution**:

(a) We know that $P(Y=0) + P(Y=1) + P(Y=2) + P(Y=3) = 1$. Hence, $0.4 + 0.3+0.2+P(Y=3) = 1\implies P(Y=3) = 1-0.9 = 0.1$.

(b) The expected number of heads is precisely the expected value of $Y$, which is
\[
0.4 \times 0 + 0.3 \times 1 + 0.2 \times 2 + 0.1 \times 3 = 1.
\]
Hence, we would bet on observing 1 head after three coin tosses.

(c) The variance of $Y$ is
\[
0.4 \times (0-1)^2 + 0.3 \times (1-1)^2 + 0.2 \times (2-1)^2 + 0.1 \times (3-1)^2= 2
\]
Alternatively, we can calculate the expected value of $X^2$ first:
\[
\E(X^2) = 0.4 \times 0^2 + 0.3 \times 1^2 + 0.2 \times 2^2 + 0.1 \times 3^2= 2
\]
and then
\[
\var(X) = 2 - 1^2 = 1
\]
