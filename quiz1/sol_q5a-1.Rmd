**Solution**:

The center is at about 50. The points of inflection on the density are at about 40 and 60, which should be the mean plus/minus one standard deviation. It looks like about 95% of the area is between 30 and 70, which should be the mean plus/minus two standard deviations. These facts are consistent with a mean of 50 and an SD of 10.
