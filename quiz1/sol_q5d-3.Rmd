**Solution**:

The left tail is 
```{r}
pnorm(-5,mean=0,sd=10)
```
The right tail is 
```{r}
1-pnorm(5,mean=0,sd=10)
```
We need to add these up to get the total shaded area.
```{r}
pnorm(-5,mean=0,sd=10)+1-pnorm(5,mean=0,sd=10)
```

It is acceptable not to label arguments, but then you have to get them in the right order!
