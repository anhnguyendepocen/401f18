The average midterm score of 19 students is 40 on 75. The professor realizes that she missed one student and upon including his score, the average went up by one point and became 41 on 75.

(a) What is the midterm score of the 21st student?

```{r,child="sol_q5a-5.Rmd",eval=SOL}
```

(b) Assume that the midterm scores are normally distributed with variance 36. Is it reasonable to say that the 21st student got the highest score? Justify your answer.
*recall that if a variable is normally distributed, 68% of the sample lies within the first standard deviation from the mean, 95% of the population lies within the second standard deviation and 99.7% of the population lies within the third standard deviation.*

```{r,child="sol_q5b-5.Rmd",eval=SOL}
```
