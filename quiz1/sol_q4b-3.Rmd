**Solution**:

The design matrix $\mat{X}$ is a $50 \times 2$ matrix,
\[
\mat{X} = \begin{bmatrix}
4.405 & 1 \\
8.963 & 1 \\
4.778 & 1 \\
4.459 & 1 \\
4.992 & 1 \\
5.443 & 1 \\
\vdots & \vdots \\
\end{bmatrix}
\]
We could also put the column of ones first. This should be consistent with how you write your model. If $b_1$ is the intercept and $b_2$ the slope, then the first column should contain the ones.
