**Solution**:

Mean average score of $n=21$ students is $\mu = 41$. Since the variance $\sigma^2=36=6^2$, hence the standard deviation $\sigma - 6$. (*From the hint*) we know that $\frac{5}{2} = 2.5%$ of the sample lies above the second standard deviation from the mean (which is equal to $\mu + 2\times sigma = 41 + 2*6 = 53$), and that $\frac{0.3}{2} = 0.15%$ of the sample lies above the third standard deviation from the mean, which is $\mu + 3\times sigma = 59$. Further, since $0.15% \text{ of } 21 = 0.0015 \times 21 < 0.02$ (people), it is reasonble to say that the 21st student who got 61 points go the highest score (as we know that only 0.15% of the sample, which is less tha 0.02 people, have a score above 59 point (three standard deviations from the mean). So it is very unlikely that in a sample of 21 (people), we would have more than one observation above the third standard deviation).
