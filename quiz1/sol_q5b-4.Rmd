**Solution**:

Since the variance $\sigma^2=36=6^2$, the standard deviation is $\sigma= 6$. 
59 is three standard deviations above the mean.
The probability that a normal random falls more than 3 SDs away from the mean is about 3/1000 (This is in the list of formulas given for the quiz, but is also worth knowing as a fact.) So, the chance of being more than 3 SDs above the mean is about 0.0015.

To evaluate this in R, we can do `pnorm(-3)`. This gives the left tail, which by symmetry matches the probability to the right of 3 for a standard normal random variable. `pnorm(41-3*6,mean=41,sd=6)` gives the same answer.
