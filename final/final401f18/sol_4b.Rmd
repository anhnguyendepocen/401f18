**Solution**:

The $R^2$ statistic close to 1 says that the model fits much better than a simple constant mean model. It does not say whether or not there is room for additional model improvement. In situations like this where there is a clear trend, $R^2$ will always be high even when the model is significantly flawed, so $R^2$ is not a good way to assess if the model fits well.

\grade{1 point for something sensible about what you can learn from $R^2$, 1 point for something sensible about a model fitting issue you can't learn from it.}
