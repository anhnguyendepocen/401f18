Let $X_1,X_2, \dots ,X_n$ be independent random variables each of which take the value 0 with probability 0.25, and 4 with probability 0.75. Find the mean and variance of $X_1$.
Use this to find the mean and variance of $X = \sum_{i=1}^n X_i$. Now suppose $n = 200$ and suppose that $X$ is well approximated by a normal distribution. Find a number $c$ such that $\prob[{X < c}]$ is approximately 0.9.
Write your answer as a call to `qnorm()`. Your call to qnorm may involve specifying any necessary numerical calculations that you canâ€™t work out without access to a computer or calculator.
