Consider the following linear model for the mouse diet data that we have studied repeatedly
```{r}
mice <- read.table("femaleMiceWeights.csv",sep=",",header=TRUE)
head(mice)
lm_mice <- lm(Bodyweight~Diet,data=mice)
model.matrix(lm_mice)
```
(a) Write down the sample linear model fitted in `lm_mice` using the subscript format.

(b) Explain how to obtain estimates of the means of both treatment groups, and the difference between these means, from the coefficients of this sample linear model.
