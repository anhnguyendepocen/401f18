**Solution**. TRUE. These are the x-values on the standard normal curve and t distribution with a left tail of 0.025. The t distribution has a longer tail, so the 0.025 point shifts left (larger in magnitude, but smaller in value along the number line). This corresponds to the property that t confidence intervals are wider than the corresponding normal approximation confidence intervals.
