**Solution**

    (i) Our sample test statistic is $b_2$.

    (ii) The model-generated test statistic $\hat\beta_2$ under the null hypothesis has approximately a normal distribution with a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 0.070, i.e. $\hat\beta_2\sim \normal(0, 0.070)$.

    (iii) We do not have evidence to reject our null hypothesis from part (a) because our standard error is about the same size as our estimate. For example, if we were to construct a 95% confidence interval for $\beta_2$, the confidence interval would include 0.
