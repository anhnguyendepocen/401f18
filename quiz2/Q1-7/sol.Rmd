**Solution**. FALSE. If we include a dummy variable for all three factor levels, then our model will be over-specified. For example, suppose the three factor levels have sample means of 1, 2, and 3. We could have an estimated intercept of 0 and coefficients 1, 2, and 3. We could also have an estimated intercept of 10 and coefficients of -9, -8, and -7.
