Let $X_1,X_2, \dots ,X_n$ be independent random variables each of which has possible values 0, 1 and -1. 
The probability of taking 0 is 0.2 and the probability of 1 is 0.4. 
Find the mean and variance of $X = \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n X_i$. Now suppose $n = 100$ and suppose that $X$ is well approximated by a normal distribution. Find a number $c$ such that $\prob[{X>c }]$ is approximately 0.8.
Write your answer as a call to `qnorm()`. Your call to qnorm may involve specifying any necessary numerical calculations that you canâ€™t work out without access to a computer or calculator.
