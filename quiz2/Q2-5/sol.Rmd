**Solution**.  
Since $\text{Cor}(X,Y)=1$ this means that $X$ and $Y$ are linear, so we can write $Y=aX+b$ for some constants $a>0$ and $b$. 

The fact that $\prob(X>y)=0.8413448$ gives one equation for $a$ and $b$.
\[\prob(X>Y) = \prob(Y-X<0) = \prob(aX+b -X <0) = \prob((a-1)X+b<0) = \prob(X<\frac{-b}{a-1}) = 0.8413448
\]
Since `qnorm(0.8413448)`=1 this means that $\prob(X<1)=0.8413448$. Since we just found $\prob(X<\frac{-b}{a-1}) =0.8413448$ we deduce that $\frac{-b}{a-1} = 1$ and so
\[
-b=a-1.
\]

The fact that $\prob(X<Y+1) 0.5$ gives us a second equation.
\begin{eqnarray*}
\prob(X<Y+1)&=& \prob(Y-X+1>0) = \prob(aX+b+1-X>0)\\
 &=& \prob((a-1)X+b+1>0) = \prob(X>\frac{-b-1}{a-1}) = 0.5
\end{eqnarray*}
Since $\prob(X>0) = 0.5$ this means that $\frac{-b-1}{a-1}=0$, so $b=-1$.
From above, $-b=a-1$ so $a=1-b$ which means that $a=2$.
  
So, $Y=2X-1$ where $X\sim\mathcal{N}(0,1)$  
So $Y$ is also normal, since the linear combination of normal variables is normal. We can work out its mean and variance,
\[
\E(Y) = \E(2X-1) = 2\E(X) -1 = -1
\]
\[  
\var(Y) = \var(2X-1) = 2^2\, \var(X) = 4.
\]
So, $Y\sim\normal(-1,2)$ and 
\begin{eqnarray*}
\prob(-2<Y<2) &=& \prob(Y<2) - \prob(Y<-2) 
\\
&=& \mathtt{pnorm(2,-1,2) - pnorm(-2,-1,2)}.
\end{eqnarray*}
