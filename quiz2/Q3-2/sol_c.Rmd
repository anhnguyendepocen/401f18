**Solution**

The confidence and the prediction intervals should both contain the predicted value, $\vect{x^*\hat\beta}$. The prediction interval should contain the confidence interval, i.e. the prediction interval should be wider than the confidence interval. The interval should look reasonable, based on inspecting a plot of the data.
