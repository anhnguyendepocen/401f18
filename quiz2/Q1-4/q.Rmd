A physicist measures extension $y_i$ for a spring at various measures of load $x_i$. You agree to help with carrying out inference using a linear model. The right model to fit is
\[ 
Y_i = \beta x_i + \epsilon_i, 
\quad \epsilon_i\sim\iid\; \normal(0,\sigma^2)
\]
rather than the usual simple linear regression probability model
\[ 
Y_i = \alpha+\beta x_i + \epsilon_i, 
\quad \epsilon_i\sim\iid\; \normal(0,\sigma^2).
\]
