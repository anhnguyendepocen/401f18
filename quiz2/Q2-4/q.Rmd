Let $\vec{U}=(W, X, Y)$ be a multivariate normal vector random variable. Suppose that  
\[
\E(W)=0, \quad \E(X) = 2, \quad \E(Y) = 2
\]
\[  
\var(W)=\var(X)=\var(Y)=2, \quad 
\cor(X,Y)=-0.5, \quad 
\cor(Y,W)=-0.5, \quad
\cor(X,W)=0.  
\]

(a) Find the distribution of $W+X-2Y$.

(b) Find $\prob(2Y<X+W+1)$. Write your answer as a call to `pnorm()`. Your call to pnorm may involve specifying any necessary numerical calculations that you can't work out without access to a computer or calculator.
