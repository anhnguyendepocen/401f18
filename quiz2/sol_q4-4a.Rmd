**Solution**:

Yes, `fit2`, `fit3`, and `fit5` would provide the same coefficients. `fit2` would give an intercept term (`mu3`) and an estimate of the difference in body depth between the orange and the blue crabs (`mu2` - `mu1`) which is coded as `mu2` or `mu_diff`. From this, we can determine that `fit3` would also provide the same model as `fit2` since by default R includes an intercept value. Similarly, we can determine that `fit5` would provide the same model as `fit2` and `fit3` since `mu4` is the same as `mu2`.

The following are the coefficients obtained from each of the models (for comparison purposes only):

```{r}
summary(fit1)$coef
summary(fit2)$coef
summary(fit3)$coef
summary(fit4)$coef
summary(fit5)$coef
summary(fit6)$coef
```
