Now that you're hopefully becoming more confident in your R skills, we can start thinking about how to integrate code and text to make a more coherent document.

# Opening up an R Markdown Script

- Once you're in R Studio, you can open up an R markdown by clicking this icon ![](new_doc.png)

- **You do not need to download anything additional if you want to knit to an HTML file.**

- If you would like to knit to a pdf, you need to install MiKTex for Windows or MacTex for Macs. You can download both of these [here](https://www.latex-project.org/get/).

- *It is not recommended that you knit to a Word document.*

# Setting up your document

Markdown is an easy way of displaying code, output, and text all contained in the same file.

- Headers are started with a '#' sign
- Text is anything outside of an R chunk
- R chunks look like this: ```{r} #example R chunk ```.

There are several useful commands that help you be flexible in displaying your output. Some include:
  - include: tells R whether to include the R code and the corresponding output
  - echo: tells R whether to include the R code
  - eval: tells R whether to evaluate the code in the chunk

- All of these commands are entered when you start the R chunk.

- R markdown automatically includes a setup R chunk (below).
    - This allows all of your chunks to be set in the same way.
    -  If you need to change a specific chunk you can override this default in the chunk.

```{r setup, include=TRUE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE, fig.width = 4, fig.height = 4)
```

**Your GSI's and Google are great resources!**

## R Markdown

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. Here is an example of outputing the summary statistics of the cars dataset contained in base R:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

# Including Math Symbols

Install the mat2tex package using ```install.packages('mat2tex')```

Note: This package is not available for R 3.5.1. To check the version of R that you are using type ```version``` into the console.

- Vector notation $\mathbf{x}$
- Matrix notation $\mathbb{X}$

- Centering an Equation
\[
\mathbf{\hat\beta} = (\mathbb{X}^\mathrm{T}\mathbb{X})^{-1}\mathbb{X}^\mathrm{T}\mathbf{Y}
\]

- Aligning Multiple Equations:
\[
\begin{aligned}
\mathbf{\hat\beta} = (\mathbb{X}^\mathrm{T}\mathbb{X})^{-1}\mathbb{X}^\mathrm{T} \mathbf{Y}\\
\mathbf{b} = (\mathbb{X}^\mathrm{T}\mathbb{X})^{-1}\mathbb{X}^\mathrm{T}\mathbf{y}
\end{aligned}
\]
